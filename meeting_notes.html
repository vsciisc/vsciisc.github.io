          <li>In the last class we started Education lectures of Swamiji, before which we read a brief intro about the author who compiled the lectures TS Avinashilingam.</li>
             <li>The lecture started with the line-"Education is the manifestation of perfection already in man".</li>
             <li>Swamiji was telling in this lecture how all knowledge is within and a teach can only make suggestions to rouse the internal teacher to understand things.</li>
             <li>Swamiji was telling about the importance of Concentration and he mentioned its power of concentration which differentiates one man from another.</li>
             <li>We had a discussion about faith and belief and Shankaracharya Gita bashya-18-66 which talks condemning blind faith on Vedas too.</li>
         </ul>
