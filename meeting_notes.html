        <h2>Meeting notes (30/12/2025)</h2>
         <ul>
          <li>WEDNESDAY, June 19, 1895: Swami Vivekananda interprets the opening of the Gospel of John through Vedantic philosophy, identifying the “Word” as the divine manifestation (Maya) and Christ as a conscious Incarnation of God. He teaches that the Absolute cannot be known directly, only through divine manifestations like Christ, who reveal humanity’s own inherent divinity. Good and evil are seen as products of Maya—both binding chains that must ultimately be transcended to realize true freedom and bliss. True spirituality lies in selfless giving, love, and service without expectation, reflecting God as the sole Giver. The world is described as God’s play, where fear and suffering arise from ignorance, while realization reveals God as the life and light within all beings. </li>
           <li>SUNDAY, June 23, 1895: Swami Vivekananda teaches that sincere devotion to one’s own natural path, held with courage and Nishthâ, ultimately leads to the realization of the Whole beyond all forms and doctrines. He urges overcoming one-sidedness by seeing unity in all beings, recognizing the Spirit as infinite, universal, and beyond body, space, and time. Realizing “I and my Father are one” destroys fear, and as spiritual awakening spreads, enlightened beings will arise in abundance, completing one cycle of creation before new ones begin.
</li>
           <li>MONDAY, June 24, 1895: Swami Vivekananda (carrying Bhakti-Sutras by Nârada)explains Bhakti as extreme, selfless love for God that brings immortality, perfect satisfaction, and freedom from jealousy and sorrow. Such love transforms human nature completely, making one “mad after God,” where all thoughts, emotions, and actions flow toward Him without desire for return. True Bhakti transcends rituals, scriptures, caste, and social rules, demanding personal verification and direct experience rather than mere belief or theory. The company of God-loving souls and total surrender of “me and mine” accelerate this love, while worldly attachments and distractions must be renounced, especially in the beginning. Ultimately, supreme love and highest knowledge are one—beyond logic, time, and space—where the ego dissolves and only God remains, experienced as infinite peace and bliss.</li>
