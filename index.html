        “My faith is in the younger generation, the modern generation.
        Out of them will come my workers. They will work out the whole problem, like lions.”

    </p>

    <p>
        Vivekananda Study Circle (VSC) is a student-led initiative at the
        Indian Institute of Science (IISc), inspired by the life, message,
        and ideals of Swami Vivekananda. We seek to nurture thoughtful,
        value-oriented, and socially responsible youth through dialogue,
        reflection, and service.

    <h2>Why Vivekananda?</h2>

    <p>
        Swami Vivekananda is regarded as an icon of Indian youth. His birthday,
        <strong>12th January</strong>, is celebrated as <strong>National Youth Day</strong>
        across India. While declaring this in 1984, the Government of India stated that
        Swamiji’s philosophy and ideals could serve as a profound source of inspiration
        for the nation’s youth.
    </p>

    <p>
        With a clear philosophy of life and a deep understanding of values and culture,
        even a small group of dedicated young individuals can become beacon lights
        for society and play a transformative role in nation-building.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is with this vision that <strong>Vivekananda Study Circle operates at the IISc campus</strong>.

    <h2>Our Guiding Principle</h2>

    <p>
        The central principle of Vivekananda Study Circle is the
        <strong>acceptance and assimilation of rational, life-nourishing ideas from all cultures</strong>,
        enriching the individual while remaining rooted in one’s own cultural identity.
    </p>

    <p>
        To this end, we meet regularly to read, reflect upon, and discuss the
        life and works of Swami Vivekananda, along with other texts that help
        deepen our understanding of his ideas.
